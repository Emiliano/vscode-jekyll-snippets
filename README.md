Jekyll snippets for Visual Studio Code. This is a combination of both the the [sublime-jekyll package](https://github.com/23maverick23/sublime-jekyll)
by [@23maverick23.](https://github.com/23maverick23) and the [atom-jekyll package](https://atom.io/packages/jekyll-snippets) by [@jasonhodges](https://github.com/jasonhodges). 

I have plans to continue adding more snippets, based on the [Jekyll Tips Cheat Sheet](http://jekyll.tips/jekyll-cheat-sheet/), but **PLEASE** feel free to contribute and/or file issues with requests.

> ##### Thanks again to [@23maverick23.](https://github.com/23maverick23) and [@jasonhodges](https://github.com/jasonhodges)
