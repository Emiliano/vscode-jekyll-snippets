# Jekyll snippets package for Visual Studio Code.

Jekyll snippets for Visual Studio Code. This is a combination of both the the [sublime-jekyll package](https://github.com/23maverick23/sublime-jekyll)
by [@23maverick23.](https://github.com/23maverick23) and the [atom-jekyll package](https://atom.io/packages/jekyll-snippets) by [@jasonhodges](https://github.com/jasonhodges). 

[![A screenshot of your spankin' package](http://jekyllrb.com/img/logo-2x.png)](http://jekyllrb.com)

- each prefix starts with jek, for example:
  - jekfm `tab` = front-matter
  - jekcom  `tab` = comment


I have plans to continue adding more snippets, but PLEASE feel free to contribute and/or file issues with requests.
